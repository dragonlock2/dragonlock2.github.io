Lego has always been a huge part of my childhood. According to my parents, I started playing with them ever since I was one year old. One of the things that I kept on building and reiterating were Lego guns. Being able to shoot at something has always been fascinating to me. I remember always working on making each Lego gun stronger and stronger. Eventually, I got tired of reloading them all the time, so I looked into designs that were easily reloadable. I never had the right pieces for more complex designs, so I eventually settled on a crossbow. Surprisingly, its still in one piece today. Here’s some old pictures.

By loading in a nail after the Lego projectile, I was able to barely pierce an Altoids tin.

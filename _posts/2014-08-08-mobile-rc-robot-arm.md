During the summer before high school, I decided to try my hand at building a robot. I took a good amount of inspiration from Robo-Cross at Muscatel. This was the perfect opportunity to try a bunch of things that I hadn’t done before. I feel like pictures will be worth a thousand words here so I’ll just post a bunch. Surprisingly, I actually took pictures of this project throughout the build process. The process was long and arduous, but I pushed through it and ended up with something that I was really proud of. The title of this project pretty much tells you everything you need to know about what it does.

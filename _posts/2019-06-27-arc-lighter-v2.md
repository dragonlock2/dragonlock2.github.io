After finishing the first lighter, I was still left with the kit I got on Amazon. I decided to make a much tinier arc lighter, preferably one on par with the size of a Zippo. First, I started by shrinking the circuitry as much as I could, while also adding a heatsink. I also replaced the base resistor with a smaller one to increase the voltage output and get the arc to around 3mm.

With the circuitry done, I started designing the lighter. I didn’t have a Zippo on hand at the time, so I worked off of dimensions I found online. I tried to make everything as sleek as possible, complete with a flush switch and magnetic lid.

After some sanding I was done. Except for having a smaller arc and more heat output, it’s better in every way than v1. It’s even got USB charging.

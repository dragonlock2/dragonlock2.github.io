In CalSol, this is a little board I designed to convert the higher frequency CAN signals coming off the MPPT to the lower frequency CAN signals the rest of the car uses. I think this was for Tachyon. It was really nice working with other people to develop specifications for a board that would fit into a larger whole. I had to head home for the summer so I didnâ€™t have time to program it or do most of the soldering.

After some revising I ended up with this.

Just for fun, I built another lightsaber between building v1 and v2. It was more of a test platform to see what I could do with PVC tubing as a hilt material. Most intriguing was trying to make a curved hilt much like Count Dooku. I also wanted to try out different ways of mounting the blade. An unexpected finding of v1.5 was realizing how much voltage drop affected the LED string, which is something I fixed in v3. Hereâ€™s a couple pictures.

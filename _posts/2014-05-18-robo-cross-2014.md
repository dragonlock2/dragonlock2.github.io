An exciting event that came in for the SciOly 2014 season was Robo-Cross. I don’t remember too much about the rules, but I do remember helping out with the build process a good amount. Sadly, I had to do six study events that year which meant I couldn’t compete in Robo-Cross. Anyways, here’s some pictures of our robot.

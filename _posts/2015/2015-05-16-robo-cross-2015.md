As a freshman at Troy, it was the last year I could compete for Muscatel. That year a couple of events rotated in and out and I was finally left with a time slot to compete in Robo-Cross. I don’t really remember much about the rules other than having to move items around. The main idea I had that got implemented was using a box to scoop up items. Since I had so much schoolwork at Troy and driving took awhile, I didn’t get to do much of the actual building. Here’s some pictures of our robot:

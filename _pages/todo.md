excerpt: A running list of things I'll to one day.

Going into industry and college, I did not expect the sheer number of things that I wanted to try learning. Rather than tossing everything onto a poorly organized sticky note, I figured it's probably best to put it in a publicly visible less poorly organized page. Full disclosure, I still use a sticky note.

# High-Priority Projects
Projects I'll get to next.

- **hardware**
    - **RViCE ADC** - first time using an iCE40, pairing with an external ADC
    - **word watch** - inspired by those word clocks
    - **solar esp32** - proof of concept
    - **keyboard v2** - full size, swappable keys, esp32 (for the low-power challenge), solar powered
    - **Linux board** - probably an NXP or STM32 chip, maybe a Zynq
- **software**
    - **LPC845 Zephyr Support** - already added basic support, do it correctly this time
    - **ePaper Zephyr support** - made a breakout board a while ago, try adding to Zephyr
    - **JABI mobile apps** - built in Flutter for cross-platform deploy
    - **CAN/LIN DFU for Zephyr** - perhaps build it on UDS or devise custom protocol
    - **MCUboot FSBL** - updatable bootloader!
    - **bootloader dynamic linking** - app calls functions provided by bootloader to save flash
    - **LDF parser in Haskell** - integrate into JABI too
    - **DBC parser in Haskell** - integrate into JABI too
    - **acoustic keylogger** - lots of articles online, seems interesting

# Future Projects
Projects I'll get to once I finish the others.

- **CNC v2** - do it properly this time, make sure it can cut metal
- **3D printer** - silent, fast, use linear rails
- **Nerf Gun** - precise, magazine fed, mountable and electric
- **Auto Nerf Turret** - become a Jedi with a reobot deliberately shooting at your lightsaber
- **Robotic Actuator** - improve the one I designed in 2017
- **Sine Wave Encoder** - worked with these before so document it
- **Solder Station** - try doing what GreatScott did and make a cheap good one
- **Solder Paste Dispenser** - auto squeezing, maybe throw it on a 3D printer and integrate with KiCad
- **Pick and Place Machine** - auto placing, deep integration with KiCad
- **Closed Loop Current Clamp** - http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu674/tidu674.pdf
- **Isolated Differential Oscilloscope Probe**
- **Phased Array Receiver** - basically a compass for radio signals
- **Drone** - make one, make autonomous, make many
- **Haptic Touchpad** - basically a Macbook trackpad
- **Expandable Cellular Automata** - Conway's Game of Life, infinitely expandable, configurable init states
- **Self-balancing Robot** - super simple but I've never done it
- **Hacked Labelmaker** - hack Dymo and make it print whatever we want with a proper desktop app
- **Microphone Triangulation** - like the EE16A lab but an actual product
- **Component Storage System** - storing a bunch of bags in a box is not a solution
- **Zynq breakout**
- **Intel SoC breakout**
- **CAN Sniffer** - no cutting wires, https://www.csselectronics.com/products/cancrocodile-contactless-can-adapter, inject a signal too?
- **Zephyr USB Rubber Ducky** - make a USB HS board first
- **Pi Zero Cluster** - got lots of them lying around, no SD cards
- **SDR** - deploy the BLE/802.15.4 Chisel code you wrote (zero IF?)
